## Technical Implementation
- Developed using Python programming language
- File-based data storage using text files
- Modular programming approach with function-based architecture
- Comprehensive input validation
- Error and exception handling
- Menu-driven interface for easy navigation

## Project Structure
- Python source files (.py) implementing the system modules
- Text files for persistent data storage
- Documentation including pseudocode/flowcharts

## Development Guidelines
- No use of external libraries
- Function-based programming (non-OOP approach)
- Consistent data formatting in text files
- Input validation for data integrity
- Commented code for better readability
- Role-based access control

## Usage
1. Run the main program file
2. Log in using credentials appropriate to your role
3. Navigate through the menu options to access your role-specific features
4. Follow on-screen prompts for data entry and system interaction
